# search_vc_by_member_claimcode (function)

Given `mist_org_inventory` resource and a Claim Code string, will return the Device object of the Virtual Chassis having one of its member with the provided Claim Code.  
If the provided Claim Code belongs to a device that is not part of a Virtual Chassis, the function will return the device itself.

The response object will contain all the information from the Mist Inventory:
* `claim_code`: Claim Code of the device 
* `deviceprofile_id`: deviceprofile id if assigned
* `hostname`: hostname reported by the device
* `id`: ID of the device
* `mac`: MAC Address of the device
* `model`: Model of the device
* `org_id`: Org ID of the device
* `serial`: Serial of the device
* `site_id`: Site ID of the device
* `type`: Type of device
* `unclaim_when_destroyed`: If the device will be unclaimed when removed from the `mist_org_inventory` resource
* `vc_mac`: only if `type`==`switch` of `type`==`gateway`, MAC Address of the Virtual Chassis Primary switch or the Gateway Cluster Master

-> The search function is case-insensitive
