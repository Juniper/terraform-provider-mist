  Retrieve a Virtual Chassis in the mist_org_inventory resource based on one of its member MAC Address

# search_vc_by_member_mac (function)

Given `mist_org_inventory` resource and a MAC Address string, will return the Device object of the Virtual Chassis having one of its member with the provided MAC Address.  
If the provided MAC Address belongs to a device that is not part of a Virtual Chassis, the function will return the device itself.

The response object will contain all the information from the Mist Inventory:
* `claim_code`: `nil`
* `deviceprofile_id`: deviceprofile id if assigned
* `hostname`: hostname reported by the Virtual Chassis
* `id`: ID of the Virtual Chassis
* `mac`: MAC Address of the Virtual Chassis
* `model`: Model of the Virtual Chassis
* `org_id`: Org ID of the Virtual Chassis
* `serial`: `nil`
* `site_id`: Site ID of the Virtual Chassis
* `type`: `switch`
* `unclaim_when_destroyed`: If the device will be unclaimed when removed from the `mist_org_inventory` resource
* `vc_mac`: only if `type`==`switch` of `type`==`gateway`, MAC Address of the Virtual Chassis Primary switch or the Gateway Cluster Master

-> The search function is case-insensitive
