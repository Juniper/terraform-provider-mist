# Mist Provider

The Mist Provider allows Terraform to manage Juniper Mist Organizations.

It enables Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automation to provision, deploy and manage Juniper Mist deployments. The provider can be used to manage Wi-Fi, Wired/Switch, WAN/SD-WAN and NAC resources in a Mist Organization.

Use the navigation tree to the left to read about the available resources and data sources.

## Authentication

The provider supports two authentication methods:
* **API Token** (recommended): Use a Mist API token for authentication
* **Username/Password**: Use Mist account credentials (2FA must be disabled)

**Note:** Only one authentication method should be configured at a time.

## Supported Mist Clouds

This provider supports the following Mist Clouds:

**Global Clouds:**
* Global 01: `api.mist.com`
* Global 02: `api.gc1.mist.com`
* Global 03: `api.ac2.mist.com`
* Global 04: `api.gc2.mist.com`
* Global 05: `api.gc4.mist.com`

**EMEA Clouds:**
* EMEA 01: `api.eu.mist.com`
* EMEA 02: `api.gc3.mist.com`
* EMEA 03: `api.ac6.mist.com`
* EMEA 04: `api.gc6.mist.com`

**APAC Clouds:**
* APAC 01: `api.ac5.mist.com`
* APAC 02: `api.gc5.mist.com`
* APAC 03: `api.gc7.mist.com`

## Configuration

### Provider configuration example

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    mist = {
      source = "registry.terraform.io/juniper/mist"
    }
  }
}

provider "mist" {
  host     = "api.mist.com"
  apitoken = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

### Credentials

Users are encouraged to pass the API Token or the username and password via the 
environment variables (see below). If authentication information are provided 
in the provider configuration and in the environment variables, the Provider
configuration will be used.

Please consider whether writing credentials to a configuration file is
acceptable in your environment.

### Proxy Support

HTTP, HTTPS, and SOCKS5 proxies are supported through the `MIST_PROXY` environment
 variables or the `proxy` provider configuration attribute.

## Schema

### Optional

- `api_debug` (Boolean) Enable API request/response debugging. When enabled, request and response bodies, headers, and other sensitive data may be logged. Can also be set via the `MIST_API_DEBUG` environment variable. Default: `false`.
- `api_timeout` (Number) Timeout in seconds for API requests. Set to 0 for infinite timeout. Can also be set via the `MIST_API_TIMEOUT` environment variable. Default: `10` seconds.
- `apitoken` (String, Sensitive) Mist API Token for authentication. Can also be set via the `MIST_APITOKEN` environment variable. This is the recommended authentication method.
- `host` (String) URL of the Mist Cloud (e.g., `api.mist.com`). Can also be set via the `MIST_HOST` environment variable.
- `password` (String, Sensitive) Mist Account password for basic authentication. Can also be set via the `MIST_PASSWORD` environment variable. Requires `username` to be set.
- `proxy` (String) Proxy configuration for API requests. The value may be either a complete URL or `[username:password@]host[:port]` format. Supported schemes: `http`, `https`, and `socks5`. If no scheme is provided, `http` is assumed. Can also be set via the `MIST_PROXY` environment variable.
- `username` (String) Mist Account username for basic authentication. Can also be set via the `MIST_USERNAME` environment variable. Requires `password` to be set and 2FA to be disabled.
