# Mist Provider

The Mist Provider allows Terraform to manage Juniper Mist Organizations.

It is mainly focusing on day 0 and day 1 operations (provisionning and delpyment) but will be completed over time.

Use the navigation tree to the left to read about the available resources and data sources.

It is possible to use API Token or Username/Password authentication (without 2FA), but only one method should be configured.

This version is supporting the following Mist Clouds:
* Global 01 (api.mist.com)
* Global 02 (api.gc1.mist.com)
* Global 03 (api.ac2.mist.com)
* Global 04 (api.gc2.mist.com)
* EMEA 01 (api.eu.mist.com)
* EMEA 02 (api.gc3.mist.com)
* EMEA 03 (api.ac6.mist.com)
* APAC 01 (api.ac5.mist.com)

## Configuration

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {

## Schema

### Required

It is also possible to pass the Mist Cloud host with the environment variable `MIST_HOST`.
