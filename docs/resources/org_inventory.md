# mist_org_inventory (Resource)

This resource manages the Org inventory.
It can be used to claim, unclaim, assign, unassign, reassign devices


## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "mist_org_inventory" "inventory_one" {
  org_id = mist_org.terraform_test.id
  devices = [
    // for to claim and man devices, use the claim code
    {
      claim_code = "<device_claim_code>"
      site_id    = mist_site.terraform_site.id
    },
    {
      claim_code = "<device_claim_code>"
    },
    // for adopted devices
    {
      mac     = "<device_mac_address>"
      site_id = mist_site.terraform_site.id
    },
    {
      mac = "<device_mac_address>"
    },
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `org_id` (String)

### Optional

- `devices` (Attributes Map) Can be the device Claim Code or the device MAC Address:
  * Claim Code: used to claim the device to the Mist Organization and manage it. Format is `[0-9A-Z]{15}` (e.g `01234ABCDE56789`)
  * MAC Address: used to managed a device already in the Mist Organization (claimed or adopted devices). Format is `[0-9a-f]{12}` (e.g `5684dae9ac8b`)
Removing a device from the list will NOT release it unless `unclaim_when_destroyed` is set to `true` (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--devices))
