# mist_org_inventory (Resource)

This resource manages the Org Inventory.

It can be used to claim, unclaim, assign, unassign, reassign devices.

->Removing a device from the `devices` list or `inventory` map will NOT release it unless `unclaim_when_destroyed` is set to `true`

!> The `devices` attribute (List) is deprecated and is replaced by the `inventory` attribute (Map) as it can generate "inconsistent result after apply" errors. If this happens, it is required to force a refresh of the state to synchronise the new list.  
The `devices` attribute will generate inconsistent result after apply when a device other than the last one is removed from the list or when a device is added somewhere other than the end of the list


## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "mist_org_inventory" "inventory" {
  org_id = mist_org.terraform_test.id
  inventory = {
    # Device Claim Code (16 characters)
    # Used to claim and manage "Cloud Ready" devices
    "CPKL2EXXXXXXXXX" = {}
    "G87JHBFXXXXXXXX" = {
      site_id = mist_site.terraform_site.id
      unclaim_when_destroyed = true
    }
    # MAC Address (12 characters)
    # Used to manage devices manually claimed or adopted devices
    "2c2131000000" = {
      site_id                = mist_site.terraform_site.id
      unclaim_when_destroyed = true
    }
    "2c2131000001" = {
      unclaim_when_destroyed = false
    }    
  }
}
```
