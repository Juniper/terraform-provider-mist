# mist_org_psk (Resource)

This data source provides the list of Org PSKs.

A multi PSK (Pre-Shared Key) is a feature that allows the use of multiple PSKs for securing network connections.  
It provides a simple and comprehensive way to onboard client devices without relying on client mac addresses.  
Each psk has its own key name, which can be used for user-level accountability, key rotation, and visibility in the management platform. It supports the creation, rotation, and auto-expiration of psks, and allows vlan assignment and role assignment for dynamic per-user policies.  
Multi PSKs create virtual broadcast domains and can be used for end-user onboarding via authenticated sso login.

Mist supports three methods of Org PSKs lookup:
* local
* radius
* cloud


## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "mist_org_psk" "psk_one" {
  org_id    = mist_org.terraform_test.id
  name       = "JNP-FR-PAR"
  passphrase = "secretone"
  ssid       = mist_org_wlan.wlan_one.ssid
  usage      = "multi"
}
```

- `mac` (String) if `usage`==`single`, the mac that this PSK ties to, empty if `auto-binding`
- `macs` (List of String) if `usage`==`macs`, this list contains N number of client mac addresses or mac patterns(11:22:*) or both. This list is capped at 5000
- `max_usage` (Number) For Org PSK Only. Max concurrent users for this PSK key. Default is 0 (unlimited)
- `note` (String)
- `notify_expiry` (Boolean) If set to true, reminder notification will be sent when psk is about to expire
- `notify_on_create_or_edit` (Boolean) If set to true, notification will be sent when psk is created or edited

- `role` (String)
- `usage` (String) enum: `macs`, `multi`, `single`
- `vlan_id` (String)

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique ID of the object instance in the Mist Organnization
