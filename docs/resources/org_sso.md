  This resource manages Org API Tokens.
  Org API token is a unique identifier used by an application to authenticate and access a service's API. These tokens are used to authenticate requests made to the API server and ensure secure access to the API. They are not bound to any specific user and provide access to the organization as a whole.
  Organization tokens support different privileges and can only be used for the specific organization they are generated for.
  Rate limiting is done on an individual token basis, so if one token reaches its rate limit, it does not impact other tokens.
  The SSO Metadata can be retrieved with the mist_org_sso_metadata data source.

# mist_org_sso (Resource)

This resource manages Org API Tokens.
Org API token is a unique identifier used by an application to authenticate and access a service's API. These tokens are used to authenticate requests made to the API server and ensure secure access to the API. They are not bound to any specific user and provide access to the organization as a whole. 
Organization tokens support different privileges and can only be used for the specific organization they are generated for.
Rate limiting is done on an individual token basis, so if one token reaches its rate limit, it does not impact other tokens.

The SSO Metadata can be retrieved with the `mist_org_sso_metadata` data source.


## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "mist_org_sso" "sso_admin_one" {
  org_id            = mist_org.terraform_test.id
  name              = "sso_admin_one"
  custom_logout_url = "https://idp.com/logout"
  idp_cert          = "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----MIIF0jC .../fSCGx7-----END CERTIFICATE-----"
  idp_sign_algo     = "sha512"
  idp_sso_url       = "https://idp.com/login"
  issuer            = "my_idp_issuer"
  nameid_format     = "email"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `idp_cert` (String) IDP Cert (used to verify the signed response)
- `idp_sign_algo` (String) Signing algorithm for SAML Assertion. enum `sha1`, `sha256`, `sha384`, `sha512`
- `idp_sso_url` (String) IDP Single-Sign-On URL
- `issuer` (String) IDP issuer URL
- `name` (String) name
- `org_id` (String)

### Optional

- `custom_logout_url` (String) a URL we will redirect the user after user logout from Mist (for some IdP which supports a custom logout URL that is different from SP-initiated SLO process)
- `default_role` (String) default role to assign if there’s no match. By default, an assertion is treated as invalid when there’s no role matched
- `ignore_unmatched_roles` (Boolean) ignore any unmatched roles provided in assertion. By default, an assertion is treated as invalid for any unmatched role
- `nameid_format` (String) enum: `email`, `unspecified`
- `role_attr_extraction` (String) custom role attribute parsing scheme. Supported Role Parsing Schemes <table><tr><th>Name</th><th>Scheme</th></tr><tr><td>`cn`</td><td><ul><li>The expected role attribute format in SAML Assertion is “CN=cn,OU=ou1,OU=ou2,…”</li><li>CN (the key) is case insensitive and exactly 1 CN is expected (or the entire entry will be ignored)</li><li>E.g. if role attribute is “CN=cn,OU=ou1,OU=ou2” then parsed role value is “cn”</li></ul></td></tr></table>
- `role_attr_from` (String) name of the attribute in SAML Assertion to extract role from. Default: `Role`

### Read-Only

- `domain` (String) random string generated during the SSO creation and used to generate the SAML URLs:
  * ACS URL = `/api/v1/saml/{domain}/login` (e.g. `https://api.mist.com/api/v1/saml/s4t5vwv8/login`)
  * Single Logout URL = `/api/v1/saml/{domain}/logout` (e.g. `https://api.mist.com/api/v1/saml/s4t5vwv8/logout`)
- `id` (String) Unique ID of the object instance in the Mist Organnization
